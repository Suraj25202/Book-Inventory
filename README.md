# Book-Inventory
This is a simple project which i created using c++ oops while learning c++ language, In this project the system maintains the inventory of books in a bookshop.
If a customer purchases a book, the bookâ€™s count will decrease, if a book is added, the same is updated.
for more information to understand the project please look into it. 
thankyou..
